This Docker image, **minimal-jdk8-net**, is a minimalistic, optimized image based on `eclipse-temurin:8u412-b08-jdk-jammy`. It provides an environment with OpenJDK 8, which is suitable for running Java applications.

In addition to the base, this image includes several essential tools:

1. `net-tools`: This package includes the basic networking tools necessary for diagnosing networking issues.
2. `netca-openbsd`: This is a simple Unix utility which reads and writes data across network connections, using TCP or UDP protocol.
3. `gnupg`: This is the GNU Privacy Guard, a free software replacement for Symantec's PGP cryptographic software suite.
4. `libsnappy1v5` and `libsnappy-dev`: Snappy is a compression/decompression library. It does not aim for maximum compression, or compatibility with any other compression library; instead, it aims for very high speeds and reasonable compression.
How to Run
To use this image, you must have Docker installed. Once Docker is installed, you can pull the image from Docker Hub and run a container from it.

Here are the steps:

Pull the Docker image from Docker Hub:
```bash
docker pull yacineall/minimal-jdk8-net:latest
```
Run a container from the Docker image:
```bash
docker run -it --rm yacineall/minimal-jdk8-net:latest
```
This command creates a new Docker container from the minimal-jdk8-net:latest image and starts it. The -it option tells Docker to allocate a pseudo-TTY connected to the containerâ€™s stdin and stdout. The --rm option tells Docker to automatically clean up the container and remove the file system when the container exits.

Once the container starts, you'll be inside the container's shell where you can run your Java applications.
